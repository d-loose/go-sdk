# Go SDK for Workshop

A development environment for Go projects. It provides the official Go toolchain,
the Go language server (`gopls`), manages module caches via persistent mounts,
and preserves Go environment settings across workshop updates.

---

## Reference workshop

A minimal workshop:

```yaml
# workshop.yaml
name: go-app
base: ubuntu@24.04
sdks:
  - name: go
    channel: 1.24/stable

actions:
  build: |
    go build
  test: |
    go test ./...
```

This demonstrates a basic Go build workflow with persistent module caching and
`gopls` available for editor integrations.

## Using the SDK

### Prerequisites, project layout

1. No prerequisite SDKs are required.
2. Your Go project (with a `go.mod` file) should be in your project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
   ```

3. On launch, the SDK configures `PATH` and `GOMODCACHE`, then installs `gopls`
   with the workshop's Go toolchain if it is not already available. No project
   dependency download happens automatically; project dependencies are fetched
   during the first `go build`, `go test`, or `gopls` workspace load.

### Build the project

Once the workshop is ready:

```bash
workshop shell
go build
```

The first build downloads dependencies into `~/go/pkg/mod`, which is mapped to
your host via the `mod-cache` mount plug. Subsequent builds reuse cached
modules.

To see where the module cache is stored on the host:

```bash
workshop info
```

### Test and run

From within the workshop shell:

```bash
workshop shell
go test ./...
go run .
```

Use standard Go commands; the toolchain behaves exactly as it would in a native
Go installation.

### Editor integration

The SDK installs `gopls`, the official Go language server, during workshop
launch. Editors that connect to a workshop can use the `gopls` binary on `PATH`
without a manual install step:

```bash
workshop shell
gopls version
```

### Environment configuration

Go environment variables set via `go env -w` persist across workshop updates:

```bash
workshop shell
go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/yourorg/*
```

These settings are automatically saved when the SDK is updated and restored
when the workshop is refreshed.

## Plugs (resources this SDK consumes)

### `mod-cache`

- Interface: `mount`
- Workshop target: `/home/workshop/go/pkg/mod`
- Purpose: Persists Go module downloads between workshop updates.

## Slots (resources this SDK provides)

This SDK doesn't define any slots.
